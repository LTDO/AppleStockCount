# Apple stock count

Change the program to work of multiples of dozens of apples.

For `12` apples it should return: `You have bought 1 dozen of apples for a total cost of 54.0.`
  
This should work for any multiple of `12`.

For `36` apples it should return: `You have bought 3 dozens of apples for a total cost of 138.0.`

Extra challenge:

* Format the prices to 2 decimal points.
* Supply the price of an apple as a parameter when running the program.
